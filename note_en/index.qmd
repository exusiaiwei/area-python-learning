# Preface {.unnumbered}

Welcome to read "My Python Learning Notes"! This is my notes and practice records for learning Python.

In my Python learning journey, I have recorded a series of interactive notes using Quarto. I adopted the form of Quarto book projects for reading materials while viewing and executing related embedded code.

The **'my-python-learning-zh'** and **'my-python-learning-en'** folders in this repository contain the interactive notebooks I have created in Chinese and English versions, respectively.

In addition, for some simple code practices, I placed them in the **‘practical_code’** folder. You can view my hands-on projects and exercises during learning Python here.

Currently, these notes are based on Swaroopch C H's book "A Byte of Python" [@chSwaroopchByteofpython2024] and written, which is under the CC BY-SA 3.0 license.

Unless otherwise noted, these notes are released under the [CC BY-SA 4.0](LICENSE) license.

After finishing this book, I may refer to other books to further improve these notes.
