## 🌟 Introduction

This repository documents my ongoing journey in learning Python. It includes detailed notes, small practice projects, and coding exercises to reinforce my understanding of Python concepts and improve my programming skills.

## 📁 Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `note_en/`: English version of my Python learning notes
- `note_zh/`: Chinese version of my Python learning notes
- `projects/`: Small Python projects that don't warrant separate repositories
- `exercises/`: Coding exercises from various platforms (currently only Exercism)

## 📝 Notes

The notes are available in both English and Chinese, stored in the `note_en` and `note_zh` directories respectively. These notes, titled "My Python Learning", cover various Python topics and concepts I've learned throughout my journey.

## 🛠️ Projects

The `projects` directory contains small Python projects that I've created as part of my learning process. These projects are not substantial enough to have their own repositories but serve as practical applications of the concepts I've learned.

## 🏋️ Exercises

The `exercises` directory contains coding exercises I've completed from various platforms. Currently, it only includes exercises from Exercism, but it may expand to include exercises from other platforms in the future.

## 🤝 Contributing

While this is primarily a personal learning repository, I welcome any suggestions, corrections, or insights. If you notice any errors or have recommendations for improvement, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
