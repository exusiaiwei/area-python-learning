## Background

Welcome to the "My-Python-Learning" repository, where I keep my notes and practice records for learning Python.

During my Python learning journey, I have used Quarto to create a series of interactive notebooks. I have organized them as Quarto book projects, allowing me to read the materials and execute embedded code interactively.

The **'my-python-learning-zh'** and **'my-python-learning-en'** folders in this repository contain the interactive notebooks I have created in Chinese and English versions, respectively.

In addition, for some simple coding exercises, I have placed them in the **'practical_code'** folder. Here, you can find my practical projects and exercises as I learn Python.

## Installation

Since this is just a repository for showcasing and documenting code learning, no installation is required.
